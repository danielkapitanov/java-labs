1) What is Java inheritance?

The ability of one class to inherit variables and methods from another.

2) How does inheritance work?

One class extends another and automatically has all of the superclass' variables and methods.

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?

You do not need to write the same code for all related classes, they can just extend the same parent class and inherit its traits.

4) What does the "super" keyword do?

it refers to the constructor or variables of the parent class from within the child class

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?

Parent>sub>subsub

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?

The child class specifies its own version of the method which is to be invoked if using a subclass object.

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?

You seemingly use the same method but the way it functions in the background differs based on how its called.

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?

Overloading a method is having many versions of it in the same class that take in different parameters.
Overriding a method is having different versions of it throughout the parent and child classes, and which one to use
depends on the object that is calling it.

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?

Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a
call to an overridden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time. Dynamic method
dispatch is important because this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?

makes variables unchangeable.
they also make methods impossible to override.

11) Classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
Object
