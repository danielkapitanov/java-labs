Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

a set of same data type variables grouped together.

2) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String cats[] = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

an array of arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

int scores[][]=new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

String temp = dogs[10];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

This error occurs when you try to store or get a value from an index of an array that is out of bounds.
For example if dogs[10] and you try to print or store something in dogs[33] you will get this error.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.

Arrays.copyOfRange(array, 1, array.length);

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

2 147 483 639

9) What is a bubble sort?

A sorting algorithm.

10) How does a bubble sort work?

It goes through an array from one way towards the other and exchanges two elements at a time if they are out of place.
This is done one less time than the length of the array.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

When you have to store data for a week, for example, and on weekends you store less data.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
sout (nums[i]);
}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
int i=0;
while (i<nums.length){
sout(nums[i]);
i++;
}

14) What is a queue?

An array that is accessed through methods in a first in first out fashion.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?

Put and Get?

16) What is a stack?

An array that is accessed through methods in a first in last out fashion.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

the fashion lol

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

when you are cycling through an array

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

A collection is an object that represents a group of objects (such as an Array).
A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections,
enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.

it includes:
Arrays, Vectors, Hashmaps...

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

int nums[][]=nums[4][6];
for (int t=0;t<4;t++){
    for (int i=0;i<6;i++){
        table[t][i]=(t*4)+i+1;
        sout(table[t][i]+" ");
    }
    sout();
}

21) What is a String?

An object that contains a set of characters.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

boolean equals(str)
int length()
char charAt(int)
int compareTo(str)
int indexOf(str)
int lastIndexOf(str)

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

the character sequence that makes up a string cannot be altered.

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?

javac Example.java
java Example 1 2
